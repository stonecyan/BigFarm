# What The Crop

An IoT project where we took temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light sensors to capture real time data on gardens/farms and help users make data driven agriculture decisions. Data is loaded dynamically with AJAX calls to the server and displayed in a GUI that is simple and effective. Users are notified when moisture levels and temperature readings reach specified levels. There are separate small-scale garden and large-scale farm interfaces. The large-scale farm interface utilizes the HERE.com API for the map and markers for the sensor nodes. The small-scale garden is a responsive CSS grid that renders dynamically based off sensor readings. 

The next goal is to create incoporate a database to save sensor data across a long period of time with the goal of visualizing data to better inform decisions. We also want to add further customization in crop selections, sensor parameter alerts, farm/garden size, and sensor node placement. It could also be a possibility to incorporate picture and video to visually track crop growth.
